# Corvette-team-project-2
In this project, we have implemented eigenfaces for Face Recognition, which is based on linear algebra techniques. Eigenfaces are the Eigenvectors of Covariance matrix of the dataset and also referred to as Ghostly images. The approach transforms face images into a small set of characteristic feature images, called eigenface, which are the principal components of the initial training set of face images. Recognition is performed by projecting a new image into the subspace spanned by the eigenfaces (“face space”) and then classifying the face by comparing its position in face space with the positions of known individuals. The approach has advantages over other face recognition schemes in its speed and simplicity, learning capacity, and relative insensitivity to small or gradual changes in the face image.
For implementation of this paper we use numpy and scikit-learn libraries. Also we needed the OpenCV library to read images. In this project we are using ORL Database of Faces[6], this dataset contains a set of face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at the lab. There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects and contains about 400 images. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions.
